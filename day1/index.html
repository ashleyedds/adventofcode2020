    <h1>Advent of Code: Day 1</h1>
    <h2>Prompt:</h2>
    <p>
      Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your
      expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite
      adding up. Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to
      2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.
