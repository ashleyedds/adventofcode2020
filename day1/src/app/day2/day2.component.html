<h1>Advent of Code: Day 2</h1>
<p>
  Prompt: Your flight departs in a few days from the coastal airport; the
  easiest way down to the coast from here is via toboggan. The shopkeeper at the
  North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop is having a bad day. "Something's wrong with
  our computers; we can't log in!" 
  <br>
  You ask if you can take a look. Their
  password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the passwords
  wouldn't have been allowed by the Official Toboggan Corporate Policy that was
  in effect when they were chosen. 
  <br>
  To try to debug the problem, they have
  created a list (your puzzle input) of passwords (according to the corrupted
  database) and the corporate policy when that password was set.
</p>
<br>
<p>Total good passwords (first rule): {{ totalCount }}</p>
<p>Total good passwords (second rule): {{ totalCountTwo }}</p>
